## setup
nodejs is required to host the multiplayer server, that handles the websockets and rooms:

1. Clone the git-repo locally:     
```git clone https://github.com/vincepr/chessjs.git```

2. Start up the server on your localhost port 8080:   
```node ./chessjs/server.js```

3. Now open http://localhost:8080 in your webbrowser.
